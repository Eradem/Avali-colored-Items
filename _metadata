  "description" : "Ever look through your mod files and find a ton of unused assets? Well I did and thought \"what a waste\" so I decided to add them in this horrible way that will probably cause tons of bugs :D. All recipies are added now and can be accessed with a new crafting table, the Avali colorizer, which can be made with an Avali characters bare hands. Feel free to message us with any questions you might have.\n \nTHESE ASSETS ARE NOT MINE. I ONLY FIXED IT SO I COULD USE THEM IN-GAME. WILL REMOVE UPON REQUEST.\n\nOriginal mod- RyuujinnZERO on Starbound Forums: http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/avali-race-mod.998/ ",
