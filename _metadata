  "description" : "Ever look through your mod files and find a ton of unused assets? Well I did and thought \"what a waste\" so I decided to add them in this horrible way that will probably cause tons of bugs :D. All recipies are added now and can be accessed with a new crafting table, the Avali colorizer, which can be made with an Avali characters bare hands. Feel free to message us with any questions or concerns you might have. Also special thanks to bunny! For allowing us to use a new look for our colorizer! \n \nYou may need Enhanced Storage mod for the coloured chests and containers specifically from our mod to function, this is due to our early inclusion of support for the mod, without our realisation that the mod itself has to create support rather than us, this cannot be changed without reverting all chests used in this mod, therefore just install Enhanced Storage mod if you use this mod. \n \nTHESE ASSETS ARE NOT MINE. I ONLY FIXED IT SO I COULD USE THEM IN-GAME. WILL REMOVE UPON REQUEST.\n\nOriginal mod- RyuujinnZERO on Starbound Forums: http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/avali-race-mod.998/ ",
